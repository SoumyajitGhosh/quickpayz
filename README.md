## Overview
QuickPayz lets you experience lightning-fast, secure, and hassle-free digital payments, available anytime and anywhere. Modeled as a PayTM clone, this project provides a robust platform for seamless transactions.

## Key Sections

### 1. Feature Planning

We begin with a high-level design approach:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign in via email, phone, or Google.
- **Database**: Powered by Postgres and Prisma ORM for fast and secure data management.
- **Tech Stack**: Built using Next.js on the frontend, with Express and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive backend and design.

We organize the system into three core modules:
- **Common**: Shared components and logic.
- **UI**: User interface design and interactions.
- **Backend**: Server-side logic and API routes.

### 2. Design (UI/UX)

- We base the UX on industry-standard principles and take inspiration from leading websites.
- The UI is built using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring that the design is clean, consistent, and easy to extend.

### 3. Architecture

QuickPayzâ€™s architecture focuses on:
- **Money transfers**: Users can send and withdraw money with ease.
- **Merchant support**: We provide webhooks for regular payments and transaction management for merchants.

We scale the system by reducing the UI complexity or limiting features when necessary, making it flexible for smaller implementations.

### 4. Stack Used

- **Frontend**: We use Next.js for building a fast, modern frontend experience.
- **Backend**: Express and TurboRepo handle the server-side logic and API routing.
- **Database**: Postgres, integrated with Prisma ORM, ensures reliable data handling and migrations.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to creating responsive and maintainable styles.

### 5. Low-Level Design

- **Database Schema**: We've designed schemas for users, merchants, and transactions to cover all essential use cases.
- **API Routing**: We set up efficient routes to handle the various API calls for users and merchants.
- **Frontend Components**: Our frontend is built with reusable components, minimizing redundancy and improving maintainability.

### 6. Key Features

- **User Authentication**: We support secure login with email, phone, Google, and OTP for verification.
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Merchants can manage transactions and receive notifications about payments in real-time.
- **UI Components**: QuickPayz offers a smooth user experience with well-designed components like the AppBar, Sidebar, and Balance Cards.
- **Transactions**: We support on-ramp and off-ramp user transactions, complete with webhook integration for payment processors.
